User Authentication Logs
========================

This module adds user authentication logs in Odoo. It logs both authentication success and failures.

Usage
=====

The authentication logs can be seen:

* on the users's form view in the *Auth Logs* tab,
* in the menu *Settings > Technical > Security > Authentication Logs*.

Authentication failure logs are displayed in red. Authentication success logs are displayed in black.

To have read access to the logs, you need to be part of the *Access Rights* group.
