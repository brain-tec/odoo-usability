    'description': """
When you have several warehouses, you have a lot of Stock Operations Types, and the menu *Warehouse > All Operations* becomes difficult to use because there are too many types of operations. This module solves this problem: it adds a filter 'My Operations' on stock.picking.type, which is active by default when you go to Warehouse > All Operations. This filter is configurable for each user.
